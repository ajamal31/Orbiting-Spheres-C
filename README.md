# Orbiting-Spheres-C

This program is all written in C. It draws 2 spheres on the screen (red and green spheres) and they orbit each other. The speed of the orbit changes as the desktop window size changes. For Example: if the user decreases the window size, the distance between the spheres decreases, hence they orbit at a faster speed.
